## Introduction

In this project, I've implemented a date formatter that takes a date string as input and formats it into a desired format. This project serves as a practical exercise to reinforce my understanding of JavaScript, particularly string manipulation and basic date operations.

## Features

- Input field for entering a date string
- Select dropdown for choosing the desired date format
- Convert button to trigger the formatting process
- Display area to show the formatted date
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For the structure and layout of the web page.
- CSS: For styling the components and enhancing the user interface.
- JavaScript: For implementing the date formatter logic and handling user interactions.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can deploy this project to a web hosting service to make it accessible online.

## Usage

1. Enter a date string in the input field. The date string should be in a recognizable format (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD").
2. Choose the desired date format from the select dropdown.
3. Click on the "Convert" button to format the date according to the selected format.
4. The formatted date will be displayed in the designated area.

Feel free to experiment with different date strings and formats to see how the date formatter behaves.
